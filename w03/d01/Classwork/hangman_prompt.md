#Hangman

Write a Hangman application that asks a user to guess the letters in a mystery word, one letter at a time. Allow users a maximum of 7 incorrect guesses.

Use at least four functions to break your program into separate modules. Do not use global variables.

**Bonus**: Disallow users from picking the same letter twice.
