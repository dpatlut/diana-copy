#Planning Hangman
Instructor models Steps 1 & 2. Students finish Steps 3 & 4.

##Prior Knowledge
- Functions: DRY, Procedural Abstraction, purpose and use of return
- Scope: Where can you access the variables you've created? global vs local, Function scope versus Block scope
- Strings, Arrays

##Building a Project
This lesson is intended to give you guided practice building a small project. Every programmer has their own unique style so don't feel like you have to design your Hangman project exactly like this sample. What's most important about today's activity is that you model the problem solving process as you design and build your game. 

Discussion: You decide to visit Montreal one weekend. How do you plan your trip? What is the likelihood that you'd leave the apartment without a plan?

  1) Pick a date and length of stay. How many people will you be traveling with?
  
  2) Evaluate different travel options: car, bus, train, plane
  
     Which metrics are most important? price? scenery? transit time? luggage? 
     
  3) Choose a method of travel. Fill out specific details. If you're driving, plot a course. If you're taking a train, figure out how early you should arrive at the station?
  
  4) Take the trip.



####1) Define Project Specs
- What will your program do? 
- What data will you need to keep track of? Make a list.
- How will you model that data? Arrays? Strings? Objects?
- How will users interact with your app?
- What elements will your HTML page need? Draw a wireframe.

####2) Create a Well-Defined Program Flow
- Draw a flow chart
- Modularize the process. Can you break out behavior into boxes?
- Give each step a specific task
- Turn the steps into program comments. Write these comments as the first "code" in your JavaScript file

####3) Implement your Code
- Turn your psuedo-code into javaScript
- Test and verify along the way, i.e. function by function
- Use console.log to test the interaction between the different components
- Build a minimally acceptable working version
- Connect the different "chunks" of your program 

####4) Spice up your User-Interface and Augment Funcionality
- Make it look good!
- Add extra/missing features!
