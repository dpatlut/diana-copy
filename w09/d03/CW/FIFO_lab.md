# Rails Advanced Topics

Break up into groups and research your assigned topic for 90 minutes.

Your group will give a 5-10 minute lightning talk on the assigned topic including: 

- what it is and why it's useful
- examples of its usage (i.e. a small working demo)
- A ```readme.md``` that summarizes the above, including links to resources

Each group will Slack a link to these repositories so that we all can apply some of these to our blog tomorrow!
