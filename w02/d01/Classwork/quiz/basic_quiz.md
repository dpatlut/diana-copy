#Basic Quiz

Use HTML and JavaScript to write a basic quiz application. 
Program this application with a partner (peer programming).

- Use the prompt and alert JavaScript commands for input/output.
- Create a quiz dictionary that uses an array of arrays to store questions and answers.
- Once the quiz is over, output a score and ask the user whether they'd like to play again.
- Use functions to split your code into well-defined chunks.
