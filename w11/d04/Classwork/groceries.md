# Grocery Refactory

Go back to your groceries exercise from yesterday and refactor your code
with the following:

* A Backbone collection for your groceries
* A Backbone router with routes for all groceries, a single grocery, and the create grocery
  view
* Modularized code with seperate files for your models, collections,
  views, and routers

Try to make sure that if a user goes directly to a route everything gets
rendered.

**BONUS**

Include a second collection with a secret menu which is only viewable if
the user goes to a special route designated by you.
