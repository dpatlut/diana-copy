### CRUDdin' crops

Justin and Jason have retired to the idyllic upstate New York countryside to pursue their lifelong dreams of becoming an organic free-range fruit jam and jelly farmer. In order to keep track of their vast orchard of fruit trees, they needs YOU to build them a custom web application. Your application will track the **color, type**, and **quantity** of plants, along with the anticipated **harvest date** for each crop. This data should be persisted to an external JSON file.

Your rustic client should be able to...

1. ...see a page that lists all current fruit crops.
2. ...**Create** a new fruit crop.
3. ...**Update**/edit an existing fruit crop, just in case new plants sprout up or a tomato blight hits the northeast.
4. ...**Delete** an existing fruit crop - in case of locust plagues or shifting market trends.

## Bonuses (in no particular order):

* Use [static files](http://expressjs.com/starter/static-files.html) to serve up external CSS and/or Javascript files. Link these to your HTML pages to enhance your client's experience.
	* Using JavaScript, add a button to your "list" page that pops up an input form as a modal. This form should allow your client to add a new fruit crop that will be saved to the current list.
  
* Use a CSS framework to style your application.

* Set up your "list" page to display all crops alphabetically, for ease of use!
