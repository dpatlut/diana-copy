# CS Sprinkles: Fibonacci, Recursion, and Complexity

## Warm-Up
 1. Print the first 20 even numbers.
 2. Print the 20th even number. 
 3. Print the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. 

## Question(s):
 1. What is the Fibonacci Sequence?
 2. How would you calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence?

## Quick Read: 
Take a few minutes and check out this short article: http://davedash.com/2011/01/28/interviews-with-fibonacci/ 


## Potential Fibonacci Questions:

    1) What is the fibonacci sequence?
    2) Write a function which return Nth number of Fibonacci sequence.
    3) Write a function which would print Fibonacci numbers up to given maximum.
    4) Write a function which would check if a given number belongs to Fibonacci sequence.
    5) Compare different methods of generating the Fibonacci sequence. 
    6) Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming).

## Potential Background Questions:
   
    1) What is recursion?
    2) How would you verify your results?
    3) How could you check to see whether your solution scales?
    4) Write .... without a loop.

## Takeaways

   - Coding interviews are as much about your *problem solving process* as they are about getting the correct answer to a question.
   - It's ok to ask for clarification. And sometimes necessary. (like: what's the first term? is it the 0th term?)
   - **Recursion** is when a function invokes itself. 
    -  Recursion requires a *base case*. Otherwise, the recursion will go on forever.
    -  Recursion is another way to produce iteration
   - **Complexity** is a term that descibes how an algorithm 'scales'.
    -  Complexity is typically determined by two metrics: *memory* and *time*
