# Rolodex

Write a command line application that CRUDs contacts that are stored in a SQL database.

Each contact should have an id, name, and phone number. 

 - If a user enters 'R', he/she should see a list of all the current contacts
 - If the user enters 'C', he/she should be prompted to enter 'new ' + name + phone. Upon receiving the input, your app should add the new contact to the SQL database. 
 - If the user enters 'U', he/she should be prompted to enter 'id# + name + number.' Upon receiving the input, your app should update the contact with that ID in the database. 
 - If the user enters 'D', he/she should be prompted to enter 'delete id#.' Upon receiving the input, your app should delete the contact from the database.
