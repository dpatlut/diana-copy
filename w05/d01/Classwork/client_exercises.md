Modify your server code so that whenever it receives a message from the client, it sends back a random response from a list of pre-made strings(you can decide what your server will say).

## Exercise: Machine Confusion

Edit your code so that when the client sends the message to the server: "are you a machine?", the server, after an awkward pause, automatically responds, "are you?," and then abrubtly disconnects to avoid confrontation.
