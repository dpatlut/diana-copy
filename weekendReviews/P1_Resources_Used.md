# Project 1 Frameworks and Resources

* [Mini Style Guide](https://github.com/ga-students/diana_students/blob/master/mini_style_guide.md)
	* Make sure to follow this guide on how to style your code so it's easier to read for yourself and for others
* [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/)
	* There were some questions about what works in specific browsers/versions. This website breaksdown a lot of various HTML/CSS items and where they work. 
* [Minimax Algorithm](http://www.code2learn.com/2012/01/minimax-algorithm-tutorial.html)
	* Introduced as an algorithm that can be used in two player AI programs
* [Fisher Yates Shuffle](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/)
	* A shuffling algorithm, handy for something like shuffling a deck of cards. 
* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
	* Cool CSS framework for animations
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
	* Bootstrap is a giant HTML/CSS framework for responsiveness and animations. Also uses the grid format we've discussed in class
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
	* We already covered this in class. It is lighter than bootstrap and may be more customizable. However, Bootstrap offers many more features. 
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
	* Another grid system. Inbetween skeleton and bootstrap with features and customization. 
* [Justin Aguilar Animations](http://www.justinaguilar.com/animations/)
	* Was used in one of the projects. Similar to animate css
* [Sweet Alert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/)
	* Was used in a project instead of modals. Looks similar and kind of cool I guess.
